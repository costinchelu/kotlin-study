    operands = an object of a mathematical or logical operation.
        The part of a computer instruction which specifies what data is to be manipulated or operated on, while at the same time, it is representing the data itself:
    variables = storage location to hold a value - acting like a container for the data
        values resulted from expressions = combination of literals (constants), variables, operators
            and function calls that evaluates to a single value
    literals = equivalent to constants
    operators = symbols (mathematical, logical, of selection) that can be applied to a set of operands
    statements = complete unit of execution - manipulating variables, assigning data-type values to them
        & controlling the flow of execution of such operations
    declarations = create variables of a specified type and name them with identifiers
    assignments = associate a data-type value (defined by an expression) with a variable (initialization)
    control flow structures = change the flow of execution and are used for branching:
        conditionals = the decision making part of the program
        loops = repeating blocks of code
        calls
        returns
