### typed nullability, and null-safety operators (`?.`, `?:`)

If you've heard about Kotlin, you've probably heard litanies about "null safety". 

While it's still possible to get NPEs if you aren't paying attention:

- specifying nullable platform-type as non-nullable

- invoking anything on an uninitialized lateinit variable

- using `!!` on a nullable and actually null value

It's definitely true that you can reduce the number of necessary null checks just by restricting input arguments to be non-null, and you can also ditch some nested conditions by using safe-call operator (`?.`) and the Elvis-operator (`?:`, think `if-null-then`).

For example, one could write the following Java code:

``` java
public class MyAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder> {
    private List<Item> items = null;

    public void updateItems(List<Item> items) {
        this.items = items;
        notifyDataSetChanged();
    }

    @Override
    public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        return new ViewHolder(LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.my_item, parent, false));
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position) {
        holder.bind(items.get(position));
    } 

    @Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        return items == null ? 0 : items.size(); 
    }
}
```

You could first write the following Kotlin code:

``` kotlin
class MyAdapter: RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder>() {
    private var items: List<Item>? = null

    fun updateItems(items: List<Item>?) {
        this.items = items
        notifyDataSetChanged()
    }

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup?, viewType: Int): ViewHolder {
        return ViewHolder(LayoutInflater.from(parent!!.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.my_item, parent, false))
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        holder.bind(items!!.get(position))
    }

    override fun getItemCount(): Int {
        return items?.size ?: 0
    }
}
```

But do we *reeeeeally* want to enable setting a `null` into this adapter? I think not.

``` kotlin
class MyAdapter: RecyclerView.Adapter<MyAdapter.ViewHolder>() {
    private var items = listOf<Item>()

    fun updateItems(items: List<Item>) {
        this.items = items
        notifyDataSetChanged()
    }

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ViewHolder =
        ViewHolder(LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.my_item, parent, false))
    
    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        holder.bind(items[position])
    }

    override fun getItemCount(): Int = items.size
}
```

### smart casting (and mutable vars gotcha)

In Kotlin, if we do a check against the type of a class, we can invoke functions on it without a need to cast it *again* with `as T`.

However, we should also be aware that this only works if the class is not a nullable mutable variable.

``` kotlin
private var realm: Realm? = null
private var realmResults: RealmResults<T>? = null

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    
    realm = Realm.getDefaultInstance()

    realmResults = realm.where().findAllAsync() // ERROR

    // realmResults = realm?.where()?.findAllAsync() // works but it's ugly
}
```

Because then we'll get an error: `smart-casting is impossible, this value could have changed over time`.

This means that calling `realm.where` is not possible, because `realm` *could have potentially been changed to null by another thread*. Even if we know this is not the case, Kotlin won't permit this. We'll have to keep a reference to the non-null instance to use it as a non-null value. Or we can specify the object as `lateinit`.

``` kotlin
private var realm: Realm? = null
private var realmResults: RealmResults<T>? = null

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    
    val realm = Realm.getDefaultInstance()
    this.realm = realm

    val realmResults = realm.where().findAllAsync() // works!
    this.realmResults = realmResults

    realmResults.addChangeListener(RealmChangeListener { ... }) // also works!
    // note: I need to specify the Java interface explicitly, because 
    // this method actually has multiple overloads. 
}
```


### lateinit vars

If we know that a property will be initialized only *once* (but not by the constructor), then we can set it to be a `lateinit var` which means "we guarantee that this will be non-null upon any actual access to it".

Please note that incorrect access results in `KotlinUninitializedPropertyAccessException`.

``` kotlin
private lateinit var realm: Realm
private lateinit var realmResults: RealmResults<T>

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    
    realm = Realm.getDefaultInstance()
    realmResults = realm.where().findAllAsync() // works!
    realmResults.addChangeListener(RealmChangeListener { ... }) // also works!
}
```

### string interpolation and """multiline escaped ${strings}"""

While it's been used in previous examples, string interpolation is preferred in Kotlin against string concatenation. We can use `$` for this.

``` kotlin
val hello: String
    get() = "Hello $name, your overlord ${overlord.name} has been expecting you."
```

What's also really nice is that you can use multi-line escaped strings, which lets you easily add a JSON to your project without littering it with escape characters.

``` kotlin
    val jsonString = """
        {
        	"hello": "world",
	        "another": {
                    "field": "field",
                    "boom": "boom"
	        }
        }
    """.trimIndent()
```

### data classes

Have you heard about data classes? They're the most talked about feature in Kotlin for its "easy-to-demonstrate boilerplate reduction".

Technically it's true, although it's also a pain that you need to have at least 1 constructor argument to use it.

Either way, the way it works is that if you specify a `class` as `data class`, then it will generate an `equals`, `hashCode` and `toString` function automatically (along with `copy()`). 

``` kotlin
data class Dog(
    val name: String,
    val owner: Person
)
```

However if you are in a pinch and need a `data class` but have no arguments, I tend to use the following trick:

``` kotlin
@Parcelize
data class LoginKey(val placeholder: String = ""): Parcelable
```

This is because while using `object` for no-arguments is commonly recommended in place of empty data class, it actually has different behavior (the `toString()` won't be consistent across processes), see https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-4107

### `when` keyword

The `when` keyword is a "switch-case statement on steroids".

`when` statements are super-powerful, because they can be combined with complex conditions, such as:

- checking if an int is `in` a range of `x..y`

- checking if a class is of a particular type (sealed class) or enum value

- *Kotlin 1.3: allows creating a variable within the `when` statement

Here are a few examples:

``` kotlin
val value = when(number) {
    0,1,2,3,4 -> 1.0
    in 5..9 -> 0.75
    in 10..14 -> 0.5
    in 15..19 -> 0.25
    20 -> 0.2
    else -> 0
}
```

or

``` kotlin
enum class Colors {
   RED,
   GREEN,
   BLUE
}

val color = Colors.RED

when(color) {
    Colors.RED -> {
       ...
    }
    else ->
       ...
    }
}
```

***Note/Tip:*** a `when {}` expression is forced by the compiler to be exhaustive only if it is used as part of an assignment.

For this, we can use the following trick:

``` kotlin
fun Unit.safe() {}
fun Nothing?.safe() {}
fun Any?.safe() {}
```

in which case it looks as:

``` kotlin
when(color) {
    Colors.RED -> {
       ...
    }
    else ->
       ...
    }
}.safe()
```

### control statement as expression (assignment of `when`, `return`)

Control statements in Kotlin (such as `when` or `return` can be used as part of assignments.

We've already seen `when {}`, but there are also other tricks one can do. 

For example, combining the `?:` operator with `return`.

``` kotlin
val name = tryGetName() ?: return // returns if `tryGetName()` returned `null`
```

### named arguments, default arguments

In Kotlin, if you feel that a given set of arguments is unclear, you can specify the name at the call-site.

But if you have default arguments, then you can "skip" certain arguments while specifying other given arguments.

``` kotlin
@JvmOverloads
fun printStrings(first: String = "Hello", second: String = "World") {
    println("$first $second")
}
```

We can call this in any of the following ways:

``` kotlin
printStrings()
printStrings("Goodbye", "my dear")
printStrings(first = "Goodbye", second = "my dear")
printStrings(first = "Goodbye")
printStrings(second = "my dear")
```

If you have added the `@JvmOverloads` notation, this will work in Java too!

This also applies to constructor arguments.



### `vararg` and the `*` spread operator

We already had the ability to specify a vararg method in Java as `void doSomething(String... values)`.

Kotlin has a new syntax for this, and an operator that is worth knowing about.

``` kotlin
fun doSomething(vararg values: String)
```

The `values` can be accessed as any array. However, what's important is that if we are passing these values *one by one* to another `vararg` function, then we must use the spread operator `*`.

Here's a real-world example to show what that is like.

``` kotlin
fun animateTogether(vararg animators: Animator) = AnimatorSet().apply {
    playTogether(*animators)
}
```

In this case, we can see that the `animators` passed to `animateTogether` are passed one-by-one to the `playTogether` vararg function of `AnimatorSet`.

### interfaces and default implementation

In Java, if you add a method to an existing interface, you will break the existing implementation of this interface.

Not so in Kotlin because you can define a *default implementation* of either a `val/var` property or even a method of the interface. 

``` kotlin
interface Animal {
    fun makeSound() { // default implementation
        println("Growls.")
    }
    val genus: String
        get() = "" // default implementation
}

class Dog : Animal {
}

fun main() {
    val dog = Dog()
    dog.makeSound() // prints "Growls."
    dog.genus // ""
}
```

What's more interesting is that this works even before Java 8 (though you opt-in with the annotation `@JvmDefault`).

Instead `Kotlin Bytecode > Decompile` shows that the compiler is creating a `static class Animal.DefaultImpls`



### generics (`<T: Blah>`, `in/out`, and star projection `<*>`)

Generics are a bit tricky in Kotlin. In Java, we had `T`, `?`, `? extends T` and `? super T`.

But in Kotlin, we have the following scenarios:

``` kotlin
fun <T: View> findViewById(view: View, @IdRes idRes: Int) = view.findViewById(idRes) as T

val activityType: Class<out Activity> // similar to `? extends T`
    get() = when(this) {
        CAR_HEADER -> CarHeader::class.java
        CAR_VIEW -> CarView::class.java
        DATA_VIEW -> DataView::class.java
    } 
}

val clazz: Class<*> = SomeClass::class.java
```

Where we can see that a "raw type" can *in some cases* be replaced with star-projection (if a generic is needed but `Any?` does not work), that we can supply bounds for generic method arguments as `MyClass<*>`, and that there is `in/out` which is *sometimes* needed (the compiler generally tells you that it is required).
