### ~~synthetic view accessors with kotlin android extensions~~

~~With the `kotlin-android-extensions` plugin on Android, you can generate "synthetic accessors" that can replace calls to `findViewById`, or using the `@BindView(R.id.*)` from ButterKnife.~~

```
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android-extensions'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-kapt'
```

~~Then we can use synthetics. Please note that synthetic imports use the view IDs directly instead of making them camelCase, so unless you're ok with your variable names having `_`s in them, it's generally recommended to use `camelCase` IDs for Android views (if you are using Kotlin synthetics).~~

``` xml
<LinearLayout
    android:id="@+id/containerMyViews"
    ...
    android:visibility="gone">
    ...
</LinearLayout>
```

~~and~~

``` kotlin
import kotlinx.android.synthetic.main.my_layout.view.*

class MyActivity: AppCompatActivity() {
    fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        setContentView(R.layout.my_layout)

        containerMyViews.show() // you can access views like this
    }
}
```

~~Please note that it calls `findViewById` again and again, in which case you might want to use the `LayoutContainer` interface (which is experimental), that lets you instruct synthetics to cache views. This is typically better performance for ViewHolder.~~

Kotlin synthetic view accessors are deprecated, and should be replaced with ViewBinding instead.

``` groovy
buildFeatures {
    viewBinding true
}
```

Then use as follows

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        val binding = MyFragmentBinding.bind(view)
        with(binding) {
            // use like synthetics
        }
    }

### `@Parcelize data class` with experimental kotlin android extensions (or kotlin-parcelize since 1.4.20)

A rather powerful Kotlin feature is the support for `@Parcelize`, which makes Kotlin automatically generate the `Parcelable` implementation for a class; this is very powerful in conjunction with `data class`es.

~~You must enable `experimental` features:~~

``` groovy
androidExtensions { // if using the deprecated `kotlin-android-extensions`
    experimental = true
}
```

And then for example,

``` kotlin
import kotlinx.parcelize.Parcelize

@Parcelize
data class PlantDetailsKey(val plantId: String) : BaseKey(), Parcelable {
    override fun createFragment() = PlantDetailsFragment()
}
```

Any variables or values given to the class in its primary constructor are parcelled and restored by the implementation.

What's worth noting is that it is possible to customize behavior if our `companion object` implements the `Parceler<T>` interface.

The `CREATOR` however currently is tricky to access (even though it is needed for `writeTypedList`), you have to access it from Java, and expose it to Kotlin (or use reflection).
