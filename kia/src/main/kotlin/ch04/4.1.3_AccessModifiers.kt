internal open class TalkativeButton {

    protected fun whisper() = println("Let's talk")
}


// fun TalkativeButton.giveSpeech() { }     // not working because of internal access modifier that is only visible
// inside its module. To solve this we may make this function internal
internal fun TalkativeButton.giveSpeech() {}
// we will still be unable to access the protected member (whisper) because here in Kotlin it is only accessible by the
// subclasses. In Java, it was accessible by subclasses and all other classes in the module.

// Kotlin uses packages only as a way of organizing code in namespaces; it doesnâ€™t use them for visibility control.

// In Java you can't make a class private so when a private class is accessed in Java, it will be package private
// internal will become public in bytecode
